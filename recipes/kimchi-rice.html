        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>      
    <li> Rice</li>
    <li> Enoki mushrooms </li>
    <li> 1 tablespoon Gochujang</li>
    <li> Garlic</li>
    <li> Sesame oil</li>
   
</ul>  
<h2>STEPS</h2>
<ol> 
    <li>Measure out 1 packed cup of kimchi, then either press through a sieve to extract as much juice as possible OR just grab handfuls and squeeze it out. I normally do the latter, but thought it would be more respectable to use a sieve for the purpose of sharing this recipe!</li>
    <li>The purpose of this step is twofold - To extract the kimchi juice which we use as the sauce for the fried rice, and to remove water from the kimchi so the fried rice doesn't go soggy;</li>
    <li>Measure out 1/4 cup of kimchi juice. If you're struggling to get this much out of the 1 cup of kimchi you measured, if you're still short, steal some more out of the kimchi jar or squeeze more cabbage!</li>
    <li>Chop kimchi into 2cm / ⅘” pieces - Not too fine, we want the chunks in the fried rice.</li>
    <li>Cook enoki mushrooms - Most recipes will have you cook the enoki mushrooms with the rice. You get a better result by cooking it separately so it doesn't go soggy, and nor does it get weighed down by too much of the rather intense Kimchi Fried Rice sauce. I cook it in sesame oil and a little garlic for flavour;</li>
    <li>Set aside - It takes barely a minute to start wilting in the pan. Then simply remove it to a plate;</li>
    <li>Sauté garlic with gochujang - This takes the raw edge off the gochujang, and removes some of the excess water to keep the fried rice from going soggy. It also intensifies the gochujang flavour;</li>
    <li>Cook kimchi - Next, we add the kimchi and cook it for a minute to drive off any excess moisture and warm it through. Kimchi does not need to be cooked, we just don't want cold bits of kimchi in our fried rice!</li>
    <li>Add rice;</li>   
    <li>Add kimchi juice;</li>
    <li>Toss well - Toss the rice well to ensure all the flavours coat the rice evenly. You especially want to ensure the gochujang coating the kimchi goes through the rice;</li>
    <li>Add enoki mushrooms back in, and toss through to disperse. You're done!</li>
