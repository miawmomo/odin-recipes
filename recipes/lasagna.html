        <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
<ul>      
    <li> 3/4 lb. lasagna noodles</li>
    <li> 1 tsp. extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
    <li> 2 lb. ground beef</li>
    <li> 4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li> 2 tsp. dried oregano</li>
    <li> Kosher salt</li>
    <li> Freshly ground black pepper</li>
    <li> 2 (32-0z.) jars marinara</li>
    <li> 16 oz. whole milk ricotta</li>
    <li> 1/2 c. freshly grated Parmesan, divided</li>
    <li> 1/4 c. chopped parsley, plus more for garnish</li>

<h2>STEPS</h2>
<ol> 
    <li>Preheat oven to 375ยบ. In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente, less 2 minutes. Drain and drizzle a bit of olive oil to prevent noodles from sticking together. </li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot over medium-high heat, heat oil. Cook ground beef until no longer pink, breaking up with a wooden spoon. Remove from heat and drain fat. Return beef to skillet and add garlic and oregano and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Season with salt and pepper, then add marinara and stir until warmed through. </li>
    <li>Combine ricotta, 1/4 cup Parmesan, parsley, and egg in a large mixing bowl and season with salt and pepper. Set aside. </li>
    <li>In a large casserole dish, evenly spread a quarter of the meat sauce across the bottom of the dish, then top with a single layer of lasagna noodles, a layer of ricotta mixture, a single layer of mozzarella, and a layer of meat sauce. Repeat layers, topping the last layer of noodles with meat sauce, Parmesan, and mozzarella. </li>
    <li>Cover with foil and bake for 15 minutes, then increase temperature to 400ยบ and bake uncovered for 18 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Garnish with parsley before serving.</li>
